<p style="padding-left: 30px;">G&eacute;mi /ge mÄ“/ is an organization formed by software developers concerned about animal welfare in rural and urban areas. It&rsquo;s began as a response to how we can improve the situation. We live with them mutually, often without realization of their needs. This is bugging us. We have adopted animals and tried finding new homes for more, felt their pain. Found current tools lacking, so we thought we could do something about it.</p>

<p style="padding-left: 30px;">We believe like all creatures we are under nature's ownership, but many animals are under our responsibility to nourish. It's unfortunate, that such awareness may be lacking in certain societies where animals need even more support. Our experience and research have brought us to realize that:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">There's an urgent need of modern, free communication tools for problem solvers in this domain.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">That's why we started building Gemi, a dedicated, open source social networking platform for animal welfare efforts. To solve these issues we're using social media as a peaceful weapon. Mobile and web apps allow us to reach people and parties involved. Enabling, encouraging to participate in crowd-activism efforts, providing those tools needed is what we are working on.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Join the initiative, help make the society actively aware of the subject, let's bring out the activist inside each and everyone of us.</p>
